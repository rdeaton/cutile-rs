## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Raw Tile IR 13.4 operations: `insert`, `fpowi`, `fpowf` (the existing
  `pow` spelling remains), GDC launch/wait tokens, and alias fencing.
- `f8e5m3fnu`, explicit pointer classification, view `inbounds`, saturating
  float-to-int, `NearestAway`, and kernel returns inside `loop`/`while`
  on Tile IR 13.4. Returns in inlined helpers or beneath `for` remain
  restricted.
- Missing raw controls: allocation, arbitrary-rank gather/scatter and
  strided view loads/stores, view atomic reduction, fast-accumulation MMA,
  exp/tanh rounding, full-width/general-rank assumptions, private/constant
  globals, and module producer metadata. Existing signatures are preserved.
- Unsafe per-launch `programmatic_dependent_launch()` on generated builders
  and `AsyncKernelLaunch`, with runtime driver entry-point lookup. Generated
  builders carry their launch mode as a trailing type parameter,
  `StandardLaunch` by default; the opt-in returns a
  `ProgrammaticDependentLaunch` builder, which cannot build a `Safe` plan.
  Code that names a launcher type with all its parameters, or implements
  on one, must account for the new parameter.
- Tile IR 13.4 bytecode with selected-assembler version negotiation and
  conjunctive version/architecture checks before JIT assembly. The writer
  preserves 13.2/13.3 layouts and rejects newer features when targeting them.
- Launch plans (`cutile::plan`), which resolve a launch once per argument
  layout and replay it writing only pointers and scalars:
  - Each entry point `f` gains a marker type `f::Kernel`, and a plan is a
    `LaunchPlan<f::Kernel, S>`, where `S` says how it may launch. The
    marker's `Params` lists the parameter kinds (`cutile::plan::param`), so
    a plan's arguments are checked at compile time: their count, and
    whether each is a tensor input, a partitioned output, or a scalar of
    the declared type.
  - Generated launchers of safe entry points gain `plan()` / `plan_on()`,
    which build a `Safe` plan; `LaunchPlan::launch` replays it, validating
    the layout and retaining tensors like a generated launch.
  - Every generated launcher gains `plan_unchecked()` /
    `plan_unchecked_on()`, which build an `Unchecked` plan: the only kind
    an `unsafe` entry point, or a launcher with programmatic dependent
    launch, can build. It launches only through unsafe `launch_unchecked`.
    Unsafe `launch_raw` takes device pointers, for either kind, and returns
    a `RawLaunch` guard that keeps the kernel's module loaded until the
    caller drops it after the kernel completes.
    Unsafe `launch_raw_unchecked` is `launch_raw` without its argument
    checks (run only in debug builds) or its guard: the caller upholds them,
    and keeps the plan alive until the kernel completes.
  - Kernels with a `MappedPartitionMut` parameter cannot be planned: their
    launchers have no plan methods, and the parameter's kind is
    `param::Unsupported`.
  - `with_options()` sets exactly the given `PlanOptions` on a launcher.
  - `PlanCache<f::Kernel>` holds one kernel's `Safe` plans, keyed by device,
    options and layout; another kernel's plan or an `Unchecked` one is a
    type error. Evicting from the kernel cache empties every plan cache.
  - `plan_launch!` gives each call site its own cache.
  - `KernelInputStored` and `KernelOutputStored` gain a `plan_layout`
    method. Its default refuses the binding, so plans of a kernel given an
    implementation outside cutile fail to build.

### Changed

- A generated launcher's launch site keeps every specialization it resolved,
  looked up by hash, instead of only the last one, so a kernel alternating
  between shapes no longer re-resolves on every launch. Every eviction from
  the kernel cache, including a selective `evict_kernel` or
  `retain_kernels`, empties every launch site and every `PlanCache`, so the
  next launch of each kernel re-resolves. `SiteResolution::new`, called by
  generated launchers, takes the `CacheEpoch` read before resolving as its
  first argument, and `LaunchSite::store` takes `&'static self`, so
  `cutile` and `cutile-macro` must be upgraded together.

- `DType` implementors must also guarantee that the type has no padding
  bytes: launches copy a scalar's bytes whole into an argument slot. Every
  built-in `DType` already satisfies this; an implementation outside
  cuda-core must now uphold it too.

- `Tensor::store` returns its completion `Token`; `Tensor::token` reads it
  and unsafe `Tensor::set_token` installs an external dependency. Explicit
  installation rejects conditional/loop regions, block-local receivers,
  and subsequent shadowing until token updates use control-flow carries.
  The raw `set_tensor_token` and `make_partition_view` helpers are unsafe;
  safe partition helpers continue to preserve the tensor's own token.

- Tile IR compiler, encoder and example/test prerequisites share a capability
  registry, with checked documentation tables. Standalone bytecode validation
  uses the JIT's assembler-version negotiation, including the CUDA 13.2
  fallback for assemblers without `--list-versions`. CI now exercises 13.2
  alongside 13.3 and the optional 13.4 lane.

- `cutile-examples` no longer depends on candle by default: the CPU reference
  helpers and the `flash_attention` example sit behind a `reference-cpu`
  feature (`scripts/run_examples.sh` enables it). The default workspace build
  therefore no longer fails on generic aarch64, where candle's `gemm-f16`
  needs the `fullfp16` target feature (first seen bringing up DGX Spark).

- `Global` now requires a sealed device atomic type, such as
  `Global<AtomicI32, { [] }>` instead of `Global<i32, { [] }>`.
  Global accesses reject `Weak` ordering and `TileBlock` scope in both
  Rust and the JIT; unsafe raw intrinsics are unchanged. This is a breaking
  API change intended for 0.4.0.

- Kernel-cache eviction APIs `clear_kernel_cache`, `evict_kernel`, and
  `retain_kernels` are available without `experimental-tune`, allowing
  serving engines to manage cached specializations independently of
  autotuning. Their unsafe quiesce-before-eviction contracts and return
  values are unchanged (#268).

### Fixed

- A generated launcher's `.const_grid((0, 0, 0))` fails the launch. It
  previously compiled the kernel for an empty grid and launched it on the
  inferred one.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-02

A single `cargo add cutile` now suffices, kernels gain Triton-parity
program indexing and Rust-model raw pointers, and the experimental
autotuner grows the pieces its first engine-scale consumer asked for.

### Performance

- Cache-hit kernel launches are ~2.4x faster on the host (3.9 us -> 1.6 us
  per launch on a Ryzen 9 9950X, RTX 5090): generated launchers keep a
  per-site cache of the last resolved specialization, launch validation
  builds its messages only on failure, hoisting shape vectors are built
  only when a kernel has hoisted checks, and kernel arguments marshal
  through an inline slot arena instead of one heap allocation each
  (~108 -> single-digit allocations per launch). Evicting from the kernel
  cache invalidates every launch site, preserving the quiesce-then-clear
  contract.

### Breaking changes

0.3.1 ships the incompatible changes below. Each one closes a soundness or
correctness hole found by the September audit, the case the 0.1.0 notes
reserved for breaking changes. Projects that are not ready for them can stay
on 0.3.0.

- `Device::load_module_from_bytes` and
  `cuda_async::device_context::load_module_from_bytes` are `unsafe fn`: the
  driver reads header-declared offsets from the image, so a truncated cubin
  reads past the slice.
- The DSL ops `atomic_rmw_tko` and `atomic_cas_tko` are `unsafe fn`, like
  `load_ptr_tko` and `store_ptr_tko`.
- `DType` is an `unsafe trait`: implementors promise that every byte pattern
  the device can produce for their `DTYPE` is a valid value.
- `cuda_core::api::{malloc_async, malloc_from_pool_async, free_async,
  memcpy_htod_async, memcpy_dtoh_async, memcpy_dtod_async, api_version}` and
  `ExecutionContext::alloc_async` return `Result` instead of panicking, so a
  failed device allocation can be handled or retried.
- `Stream::launch_host_function` and `launch_host_function_with_sync_mode`
  require `F: 'static`.
- `api::memcpy` returns `Memcpy<'a>`, which borrows both tensors for the
  lifetime of the operation.
- `CudaGraph::update` accepts only `GraphNode + DeviceOp<Output = ()>` and
  returns `Result<(), DeviceError>`.
- Generated kernel launchers return a nameable `Launcher<…, KernelArgs<…>>`
  instead of `impl DeviceOp` and implement `GraphNode` only when every input
  does; `AsyncKernelLaunch::args` is no longer public.
- `TrialLog::open` takes a `LogProvenance` (`experimental-tune`).
- `BytecodeVersion::V13_1` is removed; the bytecode floor is CUDA 13.2.
- Kernel programs: a `return` below the function body and a `break` inside
  `for` are compile errors (they were silently miscompiled); integer `/`
  rounds toward zero, as in Rust, instead of toward negative infinity; `u8`
  and `u16` arithmetic and comparisons are unsigned. Programs that relied on
  the old lowering produce different results.

### Added

- `shape![..]`: the shape constructor macro, replacing `const_shape!` (now
  deprecated; both spellings work on both compile tracks). Runtime extents
  keep the explicit form `Shape::<{ [-1] }> { dims: &[n] }`.
- `x.load_like(z)`: method-form spelling of `load_tile_like(x, z)`, lowering
  to identical Tile IR with identical bounds-check placement. Both spellings
  remain supported; docs and examples now use the method form (#259).
- cuda-oxide host surface: `simt` modules in `cuda-core` and `cuda-async`
  (contexts, streams, events, device and pinned host buffers, module loading,
  kernel launch, VMM, reclaim) and a `cuda-core-derive` crate providing
  `#[derive(DeviceCopy)]` (#233).
- CUDA VMM wrappers (`PhysicalAllocation`, `VirtualReservation`, `Mapping`)
  and NVLink switch multicast (`MulticastObject`) in `cuda-core` (#202).
- Autotuner: trial logging and resume on the `Objective` path, `require`d
  configurations measured before the search, and kernel cache management
  (`clear_kernel_cache`, `evict_kernel`, `retain_kernels`), all behind
  `experimental-tune` (#239).
- Const raw pointers (`*const T`) in kernel signatures, with `Tensor::as_ptr`,
  `cast_const`/`cast_mut`, `cast_tile_const`/`cast_tile_mut`, and
  `get_tensor_base`; `program_id(axis)` and `num_programs(axis)` as aliases
  of the tile-block id and count (#240, restored by #256).
- `CompileOptions::{device_debug, lineinfo, sanitize_memcheck, opt_level}`
  pass `--device-debug`, `--lineinfo`, `--sanitize=memcheck`, and
  `--opt-level` to `tileiras` and join both cache keys (#236).
- Source locations in the bytecode debug section, with per-callee subprograms
  and inlined call-site chains, so `--lineinfo` and `--device-debug` builds
  attribute SASS to the kernel's `.rs` lines (#238).

### Changed

- The host-side crates (`cuda-bindings`, `cuda-core`, `cuda-async`) require
  CUDA 13.0 or newer; the Tile compiler floor stays at 13.2 (#233).
- Toolkit discovery honors `CUDA_HOME` after `CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH`, probes
  `targets/<dir>/include` layouts, and accepts `CUDA_TOOLKIT_TARGET_DIR` to
  name one target tree; the host-crate tests run in the CPU and GPU test
  scripts (#251).
- `load_ptr_tko` and `store_ptr_tko` are `unsafe fn` (#240, restored by
  #256).

### Fixed

- Integer division and remainder serialize `rounding<zero>` and inferred
  signedness on `divi`/`remi` (#225, restored by #256).
- Persisted tuning records carry the L2 cache key schema, so key migrations
  are distinguishable from workspace drift (#241).
- Pointer alignment hints use the full 64-bit device address; an address
  whose low 32 bits were `0x8000_0000` previously lost its divisibility hint
  (#244).
- Generated launchers reach `cutile_compiler` through the `cutile` crate
  root, so consumer crates without a direct `cutile-compiler` dependency
  compile (#248).
- Three merges reverted by stale squash merges (#240, #225, #185) are
  re-applied (#256).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-20

This release introduces compiler optimizations that improve safe kernel
performance, async launch performance improvements, persistent kernel
tuning, and zero-copy interop with externally owned device memory. The
compiler now proves each partition access at compile time or verifies it
once at launch, and places the rare remaining check where it costs
nothing.

### Highlights

- Bounds-check placement: every partition access walks one proof ladder
  (axis provenance, static folding, declared preconditions, host-side launch
  checks) and only then pays an in-kernel assert, hoisted to the outermost
  provable loop preheader. Kernels indexed by loop iterands, mapped schedule
  components, or tile-block ids typically compile with zero in-kernel checks
  and no annotations. `PartitionMut::store` joins the checked-by-default
  surface (`store_unchecked` is the explicit escape) at identical register
  counts.
- `deny_in_kernel_checks = true` on an entry turns any check that would remain
  in the kernel into a compile error, so an assert-free kernel is a contract
  the build enforces rather than a property to audit.
- Partial-coverage launches: `partition_prefix` lets the launch grid cover a
  per-axis prefix of an output partition's block grid. Exceeding the grid on
  any axis remains a launch error, and the default `partition` keeps strict
  equality.
- Zero-copy interop: `Tensor::from_foreign` borrows device memory owned by an
  external framework (cudarc, torch, VMM ranges), holding the owner alive by
  refcount and verifying the addressable extent at construction;
  `Tensor::borrow_raw_parts`, `Device::borrow_with_owner`, and
  `Stream::borrow_with_owner` cover bare handles.
- Autotuner core: declared configuration spaces, pluggable searchers,
  resumable grid search, and provenance-checked tuning records.
- `cutile::bench` for device-event kernel benchmarking, an opt-in persistent
  on-disk cubin cache, a process-global single-flight kernel cache with a
  `.compile()` warmup API, and async launch latency at parity with sync.
- A new book chapter, Bounds-Check Placement, documents the placement rules
  and a verification workflow: per-kernel placement counts from
  `CUTILE_JIT_TIMING`, and diffing the emitted Tile IR against an unsafe twin
  before running anything.

### Performance results

- The fully checked flash-attention prefill kernel matches its unsafe twin
  on RTX 5090, within 2.5% of the checks-disabled floor.
- Async launch latency is at parity with sync, and a differential harness
  verifies that every check placement refines the outcome of checking at the
  access site.
- Grout, the Qwen3 inference engine from the 0.2.0 paper, now runs its
  25-kernel default engine path with zero unchecked kernels and six one-line
  unsafe view constructions in total, at safe-vs-unsafe parity on RTX 5090
  and B200.

### Changed

- `with_bounds` and `Dim::new` are deprecated: bounds inference and declared
  preconditions prove everything they proved, with the checks placed at
  launch instead of in the kernel. Migration notes are on the deprecations.
- Tile IR bytecode version selection reads the CUDA toolkit when
  discoverable and otherwise probes `tileiras` with a representative module
  (an entry with a `for` region and view chain), so an accepted version is
  one real kernels compile at.
- The `persistent_gemm` example is rewritten in the zero-annotation form and
  compiles under `deny_in_kernel_checks = true`.

### Fixed

- An entry declared as bare `#[cutile::entry]`, without an argument list, was
  silently treated as a plain function; both attribute forms are now
  recognized.
- Interval range facts no longer survive arithmetic that can wrap `i32`; a
  wrapped intermediate could previously discharge a check the machine value
  violated.
- Bounds analysis guards division and remainder against zero divisors,
  saturates interval arithmetic, and uses overlap analysis for `eq`/`ne`.
- Device-op `Send` bounds, CUDA driver flag types, and aarch64 flake support.
- Security bumps for crossbeam-epoch (RUSTSEC-2026-0204) and anyhow
  (RUSTSEC-2026-0190).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

This release collects the changes since `0.1.0` and focuses on low-precision
inference support while also publishing the reproducibility artifacts for the
cuTile Rust paper, *Fearless Concurrency on the GPU*.

### Highlights

- Added CUDA 13.3-oriented low-precision inference support, including NVFP4
  pack/unpack support, block-scaled matrix multiply support, and runnable NVFP4
  and MXFP8 linear-tile examples.
- Added `cutile-kernels`, a reusable kernel crate organized by function for
  inference workloads. It includes attention, normalization, positional
  encoding, KV-cache update, embedding, argmax, and pointwise kernels, with
  experimental low-level and benchmark-oriented kernels for fused transformer
  paths, KVBM layout conversion, and grouped GEMM/MoE work.
- Added compile-only coverage and smoke tests for reusable kernels, and moved
  test-only examples into the test suite so `cutile-examples` stays focused on
  user-facing examples.
- Added paper reproducibility artifacts under `cutile-benchmarks/paper/`,
  including benchmark harnesses, committed result files, machine notes, and
  plotting scripts.
- Updated the root README with the paper link, citation information, paper
  artifacts, related projects, and the current cuTile Rust execution/lowering
  model.

### Paper Results

- On NVIDIA B200, cuTile Rust reaches 7 TB/s for element-wise operations and
  2 PFlop/s for GEMM, about 91% of peak memory bandwidth and 92% of dense `f16`
  peak, respectively.
- Safe Rust persistent GEMM reaches 2.07 PFlop/s at `M=N=K=8192`, within 0.3%
  of the corresponding low-level Tile IR variant, showing safety without
  measurable runtime overhead.
- Grout, a Qwen3 inference engine built with cuTile Rust in collaboration with
  Hugging Face, reaches 171 tokens/s for Qwen3-4B on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090
  and 82 tokens/s for Qwen3-32B on B200 in batch-1 decode, showing competitive
  state-of-the-art performance on memory-bound inference tasks as measured by
  the HBM roofline analysis.

### Changed

- Split CPU and GPU test entry points so compile-only tests do not require a
  GPU, while GPU tests actually execute GPU work.
- Updated compile-only testing to use `KernelCompiler` and default to `sm_120`
  where a local GPU architecture is not required.
- Reorganized and refreshed the book and examples around the current
  host/device API, CUDA graphs, JIT compilation, performance guidance, and
  low-precision inference, with support for versioned book builds.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-01

This patch release added the first CUDA 13.3 low-precision Tile IR support and
refreshed the book publishing flow.

### Added

- Added NVFP4 support in CUDA dtype handling, Tile IR formatting, bytecode
  encoding/decoding, compiler intrinsic lowering, and the public device DSL.
- Added CUDA 13.3 bytecode, per-op round-trip, and tensor/matrix operation
  tests covering the new low-precision Tile IR surface.
- Added runnable NVFP4 and MXFP8 examples, plus a new book tutorial for NVFP4
  inference.
- Added scripts and documentation for building and publishing versioned book
  releases.

### Changed

- Updated compiler lowering, specialization handling, and Tile IR type support
  for CUDA 13.3 low-precision operations.
- Updated examples, book references, and architecture notes to describe the
  current lowering path and low-precision inference APIs.
- Bumped the workspace package versions to `0.1.1`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-16

This is the first cuTile Rust beta release with stable host-side and
device-side APIs. We do not plan further breaking changes to the kernel
authoring model, tensor launch API, `DeviceOp` execution model, or core device
operation surface; future work is expected to extend these APIs compatibly
unless a correctness issue requires otherwise.

### Highlights

- Stabilized the public host API around lazy `DeviceOp`s, borrowed/shared
  tensors, mutable partitions, async execution, CUDA graph capture, and CUDA
  interop.
- Stabilized the public device DSL around Tile IR-aligned operations,
  rank-polymorphic helpers such as `load_tile_like`, tensor views, partition
  views, memory ordering, atomics, tokens, shape operations, and tile math.
- Added type-check-driven JIT lowering with stable node IDs, richer expression
  type inference, static dispatch lowering, type aliases, global constants,
  `Global`, `else if`, and source-location preserving diagnostics.
- Added mapped partition support for safe persistent scheduling, including
  proof-carrying partition indexes and examples for persistent GEMM-style
  output traversal.
- Improved dynamic-shape performance by propagating `num_tiles` bounds, fixing
  nested partition overhangs, supporting static-shaped `load_tile_like`, and
  using zero-padded read-only tile-like loads where they generate better code.
- Added CUDA runtime ergonomics: dynamically loaded CUDA bindings, configurable
  `tileiras` binary override, custom memory pools, memory accounting, and JIT
  timing support.
- Updated the book, README, and examples to describe the stable host/device
  APIs and current interop story.

### Fixed

- Restored scalar divisibility hint lowering for kernel arguments.
- Fixed compile-only kernel compiler hooks and several JIT/type inference
  failures exposed by examples and downstream kernels.
- Fixed CUDA 13.0-13.2 `CUmemLocation` layout compatibility.
- Fixed custom memory pool resolution outside the default device policy
  closure.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-26

This release is a broad API and compiler update focused on making kernel
launching composable, removing the JIT's dependency on external MLIR tooling,
and aligning the Rust DSL with the Tile IR operation model.

### Added

- `DeviceOp` combinators, shared/boxed operations, heterogeneous operation
  collections, and a unified launcher API for kernels.
- CUDA graph capture APIs, including scoped graph capture and graph launches
  that compose as `DeviceOp`s.
- Safe tensor views and slicing, plus host helpers such as `linspace`, `eye`,
  and generic random tensor creation.
- `cutile-ir`, a pure Rust Tile IR representation, formatter, bytecode writer,
  decoder, validation tests, and round-trip coverage.
- JIT compiler infrastructure for name resolution, stable node IDs, typed
  dispatch lowering, type inference groundwork, specialization hints, and
  linker-based module discovery.
- Type-safe Tile IR op modifiers for rounding, overflow, memory ordering,
  scope, padding, TMA, FTZ, NaN propagation, comparison predicates, and related
  static attributes.
- `cuda-tile-rs` as an opt-in wrapper around the bundled cuda-tile C++ library
  and `cuda-tile-translate`.
- New examples, benchmarks, and book/reference material for DeviceOps, CUDA
  graphs, interop, tensor slicing, and the updated DSL.

### Changed

- Renamed `DeviceOperation` to `DeviceOp` and simplified scheduling around a
  smaller `SchedulingPolicy` API.
- Renamed CUDA wrapper types from `CudaContext`/`CudaStream`/`CudaModule`/
  `CudaFunction` to `Device`/`Stream`/`Module`/`Function`, with borrowed raw
  handle constructors for interop.
- Consolidated tensor copy, reshape, view, random, and creation APIs around
  dynamic shapes and clearer ownership/borrowing behavior.
- Updated kernel parameter handling so tensors, borrowed tensors, mutable
  outputs, partitions, scalars, and `DeviceOp` inputs can be mixed more
  naturally.
- Reworked rank-polymorphic macro expansion through shadow dispatch and rank
  instantiation instead of the old variadic registry machinery.
- Aligned `_core.rs` with the Tile IR operation groups and expanded named DSL
  coverage for numeric, conversion, comparison, memory, atomic, view, token,
  shape, matrix, and misc operations.
- Collapsed `load_tile_like_*` helpers into a single `load_tile_like`, and
  reduced partition view construction to `make_partition_view` and
  `make_partition_view_mut`.

### Fixed

- Corrected `arange` behavior across multiple tile blocks.
- Propagated stream synchronization errors instead of panicking.
- Fixed concurrent CUDA graph capture failures caused by unnecessary context
  synchronization.
- Fixed bytecode defaults and silent-drop cases in the JIT/compiler path.
- Restored nested marker type path resolution for static op modifiers.
- Improved compiler, macro, and DSL error messages and source locations.

### Removed

- The external LLVM/MLIR dependency from the default JIT compiler path.
- The generated `_op()` launcher variant; the unified launcher is now the
  public entry point.
- Legacy `DeviceOperation*` aliases, old copy/reshape/view helper traits, and
  unused cudarc event-tracking infrastructure.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-07

Initial tagged release. Pre-DeviceOp redesign baseline.

### Features
- Tile-based GPU programming model with `#[cutile::entry()]` kernels.
- `DeviceOperation` trait with `.apply()`, `.and_then()`, `zip!`, `.unzip()`.
- JIT compilation pipeline: Rust AST → MLIR → CUDA PTX.
- Async execution via tokio with `DeviceFuture`.
- `Arc<Tensor<T>>` for shared inputs, `Partition<Tensor<T>>` for mutable outputs.
- Flash attention, GEMM, RMSNorm, softmax examples.
- cuTile Rust Book with tutorials 1-9.
